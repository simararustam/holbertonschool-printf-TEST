.\" Man Page for _printf()

.SH Name
    _printf - Print integer, string, char 

.SH Synopsis
    int _printf(const char *format, ...);

.SH Description
    The _printf() function formats and prints its arguments to the standard output under the control of the format.
    The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged
    to the output stream, and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent
    arguments. Each conversion specification starts with the '%' character and ends with a conversion specifier.

    The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

    %c
        Print a single character.

    %s
        Print a string.

    %d, %i
        Print a integer.

    %%
        Print a '%' character.

.SH Return Value
    Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to
    end output to strings). If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.

.SH Errors
    No errors are defined yet.

.SH Notes
    The _printf() function is a non-standard function and its use is discouraged in favor of printf(3) unless
    absolutely necessary.

    Using this function requires including the "main.h" header file.
